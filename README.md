Intelligent Customer Retention System
Predicting Customer Churn Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

This repository contains an Intelligent Customer Retention System that uses Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict whether a customer is likely to leave (churn) a business.
The project focuses on data-driven decision-making to help organizations proactively retain customers.

 Project Overview
Customer churn is a critical challenge for businesses, especially in banking and subscription-based services.
This project builds a deep learning–based churn prediction model using customer demographic and financial data.

The model analyzes patterns in customer behavior and predicts churn, enabling businesses to:
Identify high-risk customers
Improve retention strategies
Reduce revenue loss

 Key Features:
 Customer churn prediction using ANN
 End-to-end ML pipeline in a single notebook
 Data preprocessing & feature engineering
 Label encoding & one-hot encoding
 Deep learning model built from scratch
 Model performance evaluation

The dataset includes customer information such as:
Credit score
Geography
Gender
Age
Tenure
Balance
Number of products
Estimated salary
Exited (Target variable – Churn)

 Technologies Used
Python
Jupyter Notebook
TensorFlow / Keras
NumPy
Pandas
scikit-learn
Matplotlib / Seaborn
